			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>My purpose of this website is a way for me to keep track of daily progression for reflection. I can keep track of what I do each day so I know what I have completed and need to work on or to work harder or work less.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>My audience is mostly myself as this is more like a personal progress or journal website. I could also show this websites to others if I want to show people my daily progress/ routine.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I won't have too much javascript but I like dynmically organizing elements as well as using javascript objects. So I am going to have an object of jounral entries. I can display them as well as filter and search for specific dates.</p>

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>The main content is going to be about each jounrnal entry and what I did that day which I'm going to use three simple examples on my Page
				"One productive thing I did that day was learn how to cook something new like a stirfry. I counted all the macros and made sure that it was good for my diet and cheap to make as well as delicious."

				Another journal entry could talk how "I remade my gym schedule as I have been lacking in the leg department and need to hit muscle groups more often with shorter workouts to better fit my schedule and my fitness goals."
				
				Then the third journal entry could be like how "I studied a new programming langauge of java and learned some new libraries and learned the benifits of object oriented programming as well as using objects."

			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				A very simple wireframe that contains each journal entry with a filter and search bar
