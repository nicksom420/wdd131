        description: "Today I learned how to cook something new, and that thing being a stirfry. I counted all the macros and made sure that it was good for my diet, cheap to make, as well as delicious. I was able to change and add to my meal plan as well as make a shopping list within my budget. This is a great step in the right direction as I not only am saving money but eating cleaner and reaching my fitness goals all at the same time. I hope I can continue to do better and find new lucrative ways to do better.",
